This project aims to develop a blockchain using Go (Golang), the Gin framework for API structuring, and the Ethereum library for cryptographic features. It will host Amazon Coin, a sustainable cryptocurrency where 10% of all transactions will be allocated to environmental funds, supporting nature preservation and sustainable initiatives.
